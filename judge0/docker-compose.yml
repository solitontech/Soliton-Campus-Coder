# Judge0 CE – Docker Compose for local development
# Docs: https://github.com/judge0/judge0
#
# Usage:
#   cd judge0
#   docker compose up -d db redis   # start backing services first
#   sleep 5                          # let Postgres/Redis initialise
#   docker compose up -d             # start Judge0 server + worker
#
# Verify:
#   curl http://localhost:2358/system_info
#
# NOTE: On macOS (Docker Desktop) this runs inside a Linux VM, so
#       Isolate/cgroups work transparently. In production the host
#       itself must be Linux.
